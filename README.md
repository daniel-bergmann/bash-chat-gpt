# chat-gpt for the terminal

the chat gpt website is too slow so I made my own version to be used in the terminal.

## how to use

0) create `.env` file
1) insert your OpenAI API key into the `.env` file
2) run `yarn` to install dependencies
3) in the root directory run `yarn start`

After the prompt opens up you can chat away.
